#Project: Matching card game
## GOAL: Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over. Example: http://www.fruit-burst.co.uk/fun-and-games/pairs-game

### How I made it:
-Created an array of images
-created a button with an event listener that would call different functions
-created different functions that would handle if the cards are a match or not and a function that checks if the user wins

### Put this code in JS Fiddle and checl it out!
